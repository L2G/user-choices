Version 1.1.6
  * Allow a :string type conversion (user request). It does nothing.

Version 1.1.5
  * Improved example files so that they don't include old S4TUtils load-path
    setting. Not needed by the people who'll use them. 
  * Example slowtests didn't set the libpath, so they used the gem version.
  * Better release process Rakefile.

Version 1.1.4
  * Enable better command_line documentation: ChoicesBuilder#add_help_line,
 	ChoicesBuilder#section, ChoicesBuilder#section_specific_to_script.
  * One Rakefile instead of two.
  * Give up on using extensions/string: too many name conflicts, too hard to 
    avoid. Facets didn't solve the problem.

Version 1.1.3
  * Bugfix: PosixCommandLineSource was not uniformly treated as a 	
    CommandLineSource.
  * activesupport includes xmlsimple in its vendor directory, which can 
    lead to "constant already defined" warnings. Don't require xmlsimple
    if it's already been required under a different name. We bow before you,
    ActiveSupport!

Version 1.1.2
  * Another stupid typo.

Version 1.1.1
  * Minor error in dependency list.

Version 1.1.0
  * Handles YAML files as well as XML.
  * Minor, incompatible changes to the API.
  * Command-line arglist handling now works with other sources the
    way options do. In particular, an empty arglist can, for example, 
    have its value given by defaults rather than locking the value
    of the choice down to the empty array.
  * Command-line arglists used to have their length specified independently
    of all other sources. Now there's a :length "type" that applies to all
    sources, including the command line. From the user's point of view,     
    though, wrong-sized arglists look like they're caught by OptionParser.
  * These relatively minor changes required a bigger overhaul to the 
    internals. They're less stupid, but I suspect they're still stupid.
  * A tutorial.
 
Version 1.0.0
  * Version from _Everyday Scripting with Ruby_
